      <h3>Phora</h3>
      <li>Marco Anthony Archer, better known as Phora, is an American rapper. He belongs to the new generation of American musicians who did not need a major record deal to make them famous. He was born and raised in California and had a troublesome childhood that saw him getting associated with notorious people. His family life was far from being perfect and he had a burning pain within him, which he later expressed through his music and lyrics. Once he entered his late teenage years, he started working as a tattoo artist. Following this, he made enough money to buy equipment to make music. He started making music at a tender age and started selling CDs outside clubs and pubs. He also uploaded his music on various social media websites. Gradually, he started gaining attention. In 2011, he established his record label 'Yours Truly' and in 2012, he released his debut album, titled 'Still a Kid.' He has released seven rap albums to date and is looking forward to do bigger things in life. In 2017, he announced that he had signed a contract with 'Warner Bros.' The same year saw him release the album 'Yours Truly Forever'.</li>
